xwiki-watchlist
===============

JS based cross-wiki watchlist tool thing.

Still only at a proof of concept stage.

Idea: Use CORS to fetch watchlists from whatever wikis the user wants, compile into one list, and sort by timestamp, and then re-render the output.

Code released into the public domain.
